Please complete the following programming challenge:

Create a 'Train Scheduling' application that loads data from a text file and has the following requirements:

Requirements:
1) Lists all trains displaying destination and departure time
2) Allows users to select a train and specify if a window or aisle seat should be booked
3) In the event a desired seat type (window/aisle) is not available, offers the option of booking another available seat
4) If no seats are available, offers the option of picking a different train to a different destination

Assumptions:
1) Your UI should, in some form, showcase your web programming skills (HTML/Jscript/CSS)
2) All other aspects will use C# as the programming language

Notes:
1) The fields in the text file are: Departure Time, Destination, total number of seats
2) The total number of seats can be assumed to be an equal split between window and aisle. 
	For example 12 total means 6 window and 6 aisle

Resources:
A text file will be provided (Train Data.txt) that contains the details of six trains departing from a train station somewhere in the western US.

Timeline:
Please complete this at your earliest convenience, but no later than 5 days from when you receive it.
Return your completed work, include all the Visual Studio solution files, in a .ZIP file. 

Please use Visual Studio 2013 or later. Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition can be downloaded free of charge from Microsoft if necessary. Please be mindful that your solution is expected to open in a standard installation of Visual Studio (e.g. do not assume additional extensions or workloads can be added to the assessors copy of Visual Studio).

We look forward to seeing your response!
