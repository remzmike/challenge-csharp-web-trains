# challenge-csharp-web-trains

Please complete the following programming challenge:

Create a 'Train Scheduling' application that loads data from a text file and has the following requirements:

Requirements:
1) Lists all trains displaying destination and departure time
2) Allows users to select a train and specify if a window or aisle seat should be booked
3) In the event a desired seat type (window/aisle) is not available, offers the option of booking another available seat
4) If no seats are available, offers the option of picking a different train to a different destination

Assumptions:
1) Your UI should, in some form, showcase your web programming skills (HTML/Jscript/CSS)
2) All other aspects will use C# as the programming language

Notes:
1) The fields in the text file are: Departure Time, Destination, total number of seats
2) The total number of seats can be assumed to be an equal split between window and aisle. 
	For example 12 total means 6 window and 6 aisle

Resources:
A text file will be provided (Train Data.txt) that contains the details of six trains departing from a train station somewhere in the western US.
